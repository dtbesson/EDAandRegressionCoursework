# EDAandRegressionCoursework

This was a coursework project for the Stats and ML module of my MSc Data Science university course. I have attached the brief given to us (StatsMLcourseworkBrief.pdf), the dataset used (PimaDiabetes.csv), my 1000 word LaTeX report (output.pdf), as well as the Jupyter notebook (courseworkPython.ipynb) and R file (StatsMLcourseworkR.R) showing the process of my analysis.

We used the PimaDiabetes dataset, which includes some biometrics on 750 women, as well as an Outcome variable which indicates whether or not they eventually end up with diabetes. We were required to perform some exploratory data analysis on this dataset, then design a regression model which would predict the Outcome variable. 

I opted to use Python for the exploratory data analysis, then R for the regression models, as this is what I am most comfortable with.

In any other circumstance, I would have used mean value imputation in order to deal with the zeroes in the dataset. Since this was not yet taught on this course, it was not required and I decided to leave it out.

Please take a look!
