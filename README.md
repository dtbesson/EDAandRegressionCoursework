# EDAandRegressionCoursework

This was a coursework project for the Stats and ML module of my MSc Data Science university course. I have attached the brief given to us (StatsMLcourseworkBrief.pdf), the dataset used (PimaDiabetes.csv), my 1000 word LaTeX report (StatsMLcourseworkFinal.pdf), as well as the Jupyter notebook (pythonCoursework.ipynb) and R file (coursework.R) showing the process of my analysis.

We used the PimaDiabetes dataset, which includes some biometrics on 750 women, as well as an Outcome variable which indicates whether or not they eventually end up with diabetes. We were required to perform some exploratory data analysis on this dataset, then design a regression model which would predict the Outcome variable. 

Please note that the Appendix section of the pdf report simply repeats what is in the attached Jupyter notebook and R file.

Please take a look!
